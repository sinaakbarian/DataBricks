# VS Code and Databricks Integration Guide

This guide provides information on how to connect Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to Databricks for running code locally. The integration is facilitated through a new extension added to VS Code, offering several benefits for seamless code development and execution.

## Benefits of Connecting VS Code to Databricks:

1. **Synchronization between Local Machine and Databricks:**
   - Code updates made on your local machine will be synchronized with Databricks. However, note that this synchronization is one-way; changes made in Databricks won't reflect back to your local machine.

2. **Remote Code Execution on Databricks Cluster:**
   - Run your code on the Databricks cluster remotely, allowing for efficient and scalable computation.

3. **Background Job Execution:**
   - Execute tasks and code snippets as background jobs, enabling you to focus on other aspects of your work while the code processes in the background.

## Installation Steps:

Follow these steps to install and configure the Databricks extension for VS Code:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

2. Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+X`.

3. Search for "Databricks" in the Extensions view search bar.

4. Click on the Databricks extension from the search results and install it.

5. Once installed, go to the folder where you want to create or work with your Python code.

6. Create a new Python code file.

7. Click on the Databricks icon in VS Code one more time.

8. The extension will prompt you to configure the Databricks connection.

9. Follow the configuration steps to connect VS Code to your Databricks instance.

Now, you are ready to seamlessly develop and execute your code using the power of Databricks within Visual Studio Code.
